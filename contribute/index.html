                If you think that you have found a security issue with the Slim Framework, don't use the
                support forum or issue tracker and don't publish the issue publicly. Instead, email all
                security issues to <strong>security [at] slimframework.com</strong>.

        <h2>Contributor Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            All developers are different, and this is why the Slim Framework project
            has contributor guidelines. These ensure all contributors follow the same
            rules and the same code style.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a> compliant code</li>
            <li>Use UNIX line returns</li>
            <li>Remove trailing white space</li>
            <li>Use 4 spaces instead of tabs</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Pull Requests</h2>
        <p>
            Separate each new feature or improvement into a separate branch in your forked repository.
            Submit a pull request from each feature branch to the Slim Framework repository's <code>develop</code>
            branch. All changes should include appropriate PHPUnit tests.
