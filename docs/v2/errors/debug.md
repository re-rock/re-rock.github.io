title: Debug
---
You can enable debugging during application instantiation with this setting:

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim(array(
        'debug' => true
    ));

You may also enable debugging during runtime with the Slim applicationâ€™s `config()` instance method:

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();

    //Enable debugging (on by default)
    $app->config('debug', true);

    //Disable debugging
    $app->config('debug', false);

If debugging is enabled and an exception or error occurs, a diagnostic screen will appear with the error description,
the affected file, the file line number, and a stack trace. If debugging is disabled, the custom Error handler will
be invoked instead.
