You may use the Slim application’s `error()` method to specify a custom error handler to be invoked when an error or
exception occurs. Custom error handlers are only invoked if application debugging is disabled.

A custom error handler should render a user-friendly message that mitigates user confusion. Similar to the Slim
application’s `notFound()` method, the `error()` method acts as both a getter and a setter.

### Set custom error handler

You may set a custom error handler by passing a callable into the Slim application's `error()` method as its first
and only argument.

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->error(function (\Exception $e) use ($app) {
        $app->render('error.php');
    });

In this example, the custom error handler accepts the caught Exception as its argument. This allows you to respond
appropriately to different exceptions.

### Invoke custom error handler

Usually, the Slim application will automatically invoke the error handler when an exception or error occurs.
However, you may also manually invoke the error handler with the Slim application’s `error()` method
(without an argument).
