The Slim Framework helps you map resource URIs to callback functions for specific HTTP request methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS or HEAD). A Slim application will invoke the first route that matches the current HTTP requestâ€™s URI and method.

If the Slim application does not find routes with URIs that match the HTTP request URI and method, it will automatically return a 404 Not Found response.
