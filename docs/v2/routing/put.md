title: PUT
---
Use the Slim application's `put()` method to map a callback function to a resource URI that is requested with
the HTTP PUT method.

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->put('/books/:id', function ($id) {
        //Update book identified by $id
    });

In this example, an HTTP PUT request for “/books/1” will invoke the associated callback function, passing "1" as
the callback function's argument.

The first argument of the Slim application's `put()` method is the resource URI. The last argument is anything that
returns `true` for `is_callable()`. Typically, the last argument will be an [anonymous function][anon-func].

### Method Override

Unfortunately, modern browsers do not provide native support for HTTP PUT requests. To work around this limitation,
ensure your HTML form’s method attribute is “post”, then add a method override parameter to your HTML form like this:

    <form action="/books/1" method="post">
        ... other form fields here...
        <input type="hidden" name="_METHOD" value="PUT"/>
        <input type="submit" value="Update Book"/>
    </form>

If you are using [Backbone.js][backbone] or a command-line HTTP client, you may also override the HTTP method by
using the **X-HTTP-Method-Override** header.
