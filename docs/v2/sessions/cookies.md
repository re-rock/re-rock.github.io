title: Cookies

You may also use the `\Slim\Middleware\SessionCookie` middleware to persist session data in encrypted, hashed
HTTP cookies. To enable the session cookie middleware, add the `\Slim\Middleware\SessionCookie` middleware to your
Slim application:

    <?php
    $app = new Slim();
    $app->add(new \Slim\Middleware\SessionCookie(array(
        'expires' => '20 minutes',
        'path' => '/',
        'domain' => null,
        'secure' => false,
        'httponly' => false,
        'name' => 'slim_session',
        'secret' => 'CHANGE_ME',
        'cipher' => MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256,
        'cipher_mode' => MCRYPT_MODE_CBC
    )));

The second argument is optional; it is shown here so you can see the default middleware settings. The session cookie
middleware will work seamlessly with the `$_SESSION` superglobal so you can easily migrate to this session storage
middleware with zero changes to your application code.

If you use the session cookie middleware, you DO NOT need to start a native PHP session. The `$_SESSION` superglobal
will still be available, and it will be persisted into an HTTP cookie via the middleware layer rather than with
PHP’s native session management.

Remember, HTTP cookies are inherently limited to only 4 kilobytes of data. If your encrypted session data will exceed
this length, you should instead rely on PHP’s native sessions or an alternate session store.

<div class="alert">
    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Client-side storage of session data is not recommended if you are
    dealing with sensitive information, even when using Slim's encrypted session cookie middleware.
    If you need to store sensitive information, you should encrypt and store the session information
    on your server.
