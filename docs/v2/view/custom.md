A Slim application delegates rendering of templates to its view object. A custom view is a subclass
of `\Slim\View` that implements this interface:

    <?php
    public render(string $template);

The view object's `render` method must return the rendered content of the template specified by its
`$template` argument. When the custom view’s render method is invoked, it is passed the desired template
pathname (relative to the Slim application's “templates.path” setting) as its argument. Here's an example
custom view:

    <?php
    class CustomView extends \Slim\View
    {
        public function render($template)
        {
            return 'The final rendered template';
        }
    }

The custom view can do whatever it wants internally so long as it returns the template’s rendered output as a string.
A custom view makes it easy to integrate popular PHP template systems like Twig or Smarty.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Heads Up!</strong> A custom view may access data passed to it by the Slim application’s
    <code>render()</code> method with <code>$this->data</code>.
</div>

You can browse ready-to-use custom views that work with popular PHP template engines in the Slim-Extras repository
on GitHub.

### Example View

    <?php
    class CustomView extends \Slim\View
    {
        public function render($template)
        {
            // $template === 'show.php'
            // $this->data['title'] === 'Sahara'
        }
    }

### Example Integration

If the custom view is not discoverable by a registered autoloader, it must be required before the Slim application
is instantiated.

    <?php
    require 'CustomView.php';

    $app = new \Slim\Slim(array(
        'view' => new CustomView()
    ));

    $app->get('/books/:id', function ($id) use ($app) {
        $app->render('show.php', array('title' => 'Sahara'));
    });

    $app->run();
