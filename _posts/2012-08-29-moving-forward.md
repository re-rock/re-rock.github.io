description: The next version of the Slim Framework will provide namespaces and PSR-2 compliance

The next version of the Slim Framework will introduce PHP [namespaces](http://us3.php.net/manual/language.namespaces.php) and [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) compliance. Because this is a large departure from the past, I will tag this version “2.0” when it is released (soon).

Why the big change? I started and maintain [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/), and I believe I should practice what I preach. The Slim Framework currently supports PHP 5.2 or newer. Unfortunately, providing backwards compatibility prevents me from introducing newer features and improvements to the framework. I’ve decided it’s time to adopt modern best practices and move forward.

The next version of the Slim Framework will require PHP 5.3 or newer. Starting today, the develop branch includes the PHP >= 5.3 code.

I’m currently updating the framework documentation to reflect these changes. The framework documentation will move into its own separate GitHub Pages repository before the 2.0 release.
