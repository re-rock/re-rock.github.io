It's a new year, so a new Slim! Like 3.11.0, version 3.12.0 is nearly entirely bug fixes.

In particular, [#2543](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2543) & [#2558](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2558) enable Slim to be used with Diactoros which requires `read()` to be called with an integer.

Also, [#2519](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2519) adds `getBasePath()` to the `Router` object.
