With the end of summer, we are delighted to release Slim 3.11.0. This version is pretty much entirely bug fixes.

There are two fixes that are particular useful:

Firstly, [#2441](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2441) ensures that Slim correctly overrides default headers when they are added to the Response object and secondly [#2487](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2487) means that Slim now plays nicer with proxies such as ngrok when the public URL is on a different port to the internal PHP server.

There are of course a number of other bug fixes that people have found and fixed for us. Thanks!
