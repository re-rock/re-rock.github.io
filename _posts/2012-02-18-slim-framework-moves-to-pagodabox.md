The Slim Framework website is now hosted with [Pagoda Box](http://pagodabox.com/). I’m super excited about the move. If you haven’t heard already, Pagoda Box is a PHP PaaS that provides a very flexible and scalable architecture for your PHP applications.

Pagoda Box allows me to develop and test Slim’s website locally in my own Git repository where I can experiment with new website features in separate Git branches. When I’m ready to push a new feature into production, I `git push` my changes to the Pagoda Box platform where they are instantly distributed and deployed.

I want to extend a big “thank you” to Steve, Scott, and the rest of the Pagoda Box team for hosting Slim’s website and for helping with Slim’s continued growth and future development.
