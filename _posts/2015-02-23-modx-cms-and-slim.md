The popular [MODX](http://modx.com) content management platform will be rebuilt on top of the upcoming Slim Framework 3.x release. This is exciting news! [Jason Coward](https://twitter.com/drumshaman), co-founder and lead architect of MODX, announced the decision this morning [on his Medium blog](https://medium.com/@drumshaman/keeping-modx-relevant-part-two-15a37eab5b48). Jason attributes his decision to Slim's early adoption of the [PSR-7 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md), Slim's abundant unit tests, Slim's middleware architecture, and Slim's overall minimalist approach. I can't wait to see what MODX has in store!
