After the release of 3.9.0, a regression and an unexpected side-effect of a bug fix were noticed.

Firstly, you could not clear the user's password when using `Uri::withUserInfo('')`, so this is fixed in [#2332](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2332).

Secondly, we discovered that `return $response->withHeader('Location', '/login');` no longer redirected in a browser. This isn't a surprise as the `302` status code isn't explicitly set developers were relying on a feature of PHP's [`header()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php) function that set `302` for them. This side-effect was causing other issues such as [#1730](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1730), so it was fixed in 3.9.0.  To mitigate the effect of this change, 3.9.1 includes [#2345](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2345) which sets the status code to `302` when you add a `Location` header if the status code is currently 200. This change will not be forward-ported to 4.x though.

*Update:* Shortly after the release of 3.9.1, it was discovered that [#2342](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/2342) should not have been merged as it breaks BC, so this PR was reverted in 3.9.2.
