We are delighted to release Slim 3.9.0. As Slim 3 is stable, there's mostly bug fixes in this version.

Probably the most noticeable changes are that we now allow any HTTP method name in the Request object and the Uri now correctly encodes the user information, which will ensure user names and passwords with reserved characters such as `@` will work as you expect. Also in the HTTP component, the Request's `getParams()` now allows you to provide a list of the parameters you want returned, allowing you to filter for a specific set.

As usual, there are also some bug fixes, particularly around the output buffering setting and you can now use any HTTP method you want to without getting an error.

The full list of changes is [here](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues?q=milestone%3A3.9.0+is%3Aclosed)
