# Stability Status
Very stable. No bugs have been reported since alpha release, we have also increased test coverage to 99% (I know, it's not necessarily a great metric but fantastic achievement nonetheless). Thanks @adriansuter for all the work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/l0gicgate/Slim-Skeleton.git
git checkout 4.x
```
