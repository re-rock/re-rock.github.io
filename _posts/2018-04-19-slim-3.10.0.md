We are delighted to release Slim 3.10.0. This version has a couple of minor new features and a couple of bug fixes.

The most noticeable improvement is that we now support `$app->redirect('/from', '/to')` to allow quick and easy redirecting of one path to another without having to write a route handler yourself. We have also added support for the `SameSite` flag in `Slim\Http\Cookies`

As usual, there are also some bug fixes, particularly we no longer override the Host header in the request if it's already defined.

The full list of changes is [here](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues?q=milestone%3A3.10.0+is%3Aclosed)
