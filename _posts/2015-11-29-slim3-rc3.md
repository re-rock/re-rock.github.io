We have now released the [third release candidate of Slim 3](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/tree/3.0.0-RC3) following testing of RC2. This release fixes a security issue, clears up some inconsistencies and fixes a number of bugs.

## Security fix in 3.0.0-RC3:

* [#1624](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1624) - XXE attacks are now prevented when parsing XML input.


## BC breaks in 3.0.0-RC3:

These are the BC breaks since RC2:

* [#1631](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1631) - The route callable is now bound to the Container rather than to the App to be consistent with middleware binding. This means that if you are using `$this->subRequest` then you now need to `use ($app)` and then `$app->subRequest(…)`. Also if you were using `$this->getContainer()->get(…)`, you need to change this to `$this->get(…)`. Note that using `$this->foo` to retrieve a service from the container continues to work.
* [#1626](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1626) - Route paths are now simply concatenated with no magic. This may affect the way route groups were previously set up, but from now on, it's very predictable.
* [#1625](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/pull/1625) - Group middleware is now executed before the route's middleware as you would expect. See issue [#1622](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1622) for details.

## Getting started

To get started, you can follow the [installation instructions](http://www.slimframework.com/docs/start/installation.html) or use [Rob Allen](https://twitter.com/akrabat)'s [skeleton application](http://akrabat.com/a-slim3-skeleton/).

## Please test!

We would appreciate it if you could test this release candidate and [report](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues) all issues that you find. We are hoping that this is the final release candidate (again!) and that 3.0 final will be released imminently. Note though, that as this is a release candidate, we do not promise that there will be no BC breaks until 3.0 final is released.
