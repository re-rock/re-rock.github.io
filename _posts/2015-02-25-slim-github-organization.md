The Slim Framework code repositories have a new home in their very own [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/slimphp). As much as I'd like to keep the project beneath my own GitHub handle for the notoriety and what not, the project is best served with its own GitHub Organization. This solves several problems.

First, it solves the bus factor. Should anyone decide to run me over with a bus (please don't), the GitHub project is not owned by a single individual. Instead, it is owned by a team of dedicated users who all have access to the necessary repositories. Second, it consolidates all of Slim's related repositories beneath a single umbrella to simplify discovery and improve the project's brand.

For those of you who install Slim with Composer, you do not need to change anything. Composer installation works exactly the same as before.
